For instructions, and example go to my website: https://bugdroidtech.blogspot.com/2025/01/csv-numbering-tool-for-printing-items.html

MakeNumbersCSV.js contains a simple and efficient JavaScript function designed to generate CSV files for numbering printed items, such as raffle tickets. It eliminates the need for spreadsheets by directly creating a CSV file from the script, making the process faster and more flexible.
This is particularly useful for integrating the Data Merge/Variable Print function in graphical software like Adobe InDesign.

Features:
- Automatically generates sequential numbers for printing.
- Outputs a CSV file easily imported into InDesign or similar software.
- Ideal for numbered items such as raffle tickets, invoices, or lots.
- Simple and efficient without requiring spreadsheets.
- The items quantity and sheets to print are adjusted based on items per sheet (numerators) and sheets per blocks. The function will inform you accordingly.

How to Use:
- Include the MakeNumbersCSV.js file in your project.
- Configure the script to set your desired number range and file output.
- Use the generated CSV in InDesign's Data Merge/Variable Print feature.
