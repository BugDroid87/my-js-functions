Available for use directly on my website: https://bug87droid.blogspot.com/2025/01/csv-numbering.html

MakeNumbersCSV.js is a simple, efficient JavaScript tool designed to generate CSV files for numbering printed items such as raffle tickets, invoices, and lots. It eliminates the need for spreadsheets by creating a CSV directly from a script, making the process faster and more flexible.

This tool is particularly useful for integration with the Data Merge/Variable Print function in graphical software like Adobe InDesign. Whether you're working on a design project or preparing documents for print, MakeNumbersCSV.js helps automate the numbering of items for mass printing without complex setup or reliance on external software.

Features:
- Automatically generates sequential numbers for printing.
- Outputs a CSV file for easy import into InDesign or similar software.
- Ideal for numbered items such as raffle tickets, invoices, or lots.
- Simple and efficient without requiring spreadsheets.

How to Use:
- Include the MakeNumbersCSV.js file in your project.
- Configure the script to set your desired number range and file output.
- Use the generated CSV in InDesign's Data Merge/Variable Print feature.
